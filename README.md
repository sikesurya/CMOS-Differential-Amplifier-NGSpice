# Differential Amplifier using 180nm CMOS Technology

This project involves the design and simulation of a differential amplifier using 180nm CMOS technology. Differential amplifiers are fundamental building blocks in analog circuit design due to their high gain, common-mode noise rejection, and improved SNR.
